          <p>
            I'm David Kovacs, a Budapest (HU) based DJ/Producer, active for more than 12 years now. -(formerly known as
            Bonvibe)- <br />

            'David Kovacs' being my actual name as a person, my stage name as a DJ &#38; also one of the most common
            names in my home country (separately &#38; combined as well) - I'm regarding it more like a version of 'John
            Doe'... an anonymous... a face in the crowd. <br />
            Many others in the history of electronic music wore flashy helmets and masks to hide the individual self,
            thus the focus can be on their music, their craft.<br />
            For me, my name is my helmet.<br />
            It's like a secret code to earn entrance into a club known only by a few - YOU are part of the few!
            <br />I'm not USING music to speak in my behalf.<br />
            I LET the music speak for itself.<br />
            It's unstoppable... aiming to conquer your hearts one by one.<br />
            It takes time but music is timeless.<br />
            It's here to stay.<br />
            I'm here to stay.<br /><br />
            As for my style... I'm blending genres creating stiff alloys.<br />
            Like a Blacksmith would do... a 'Kovács'.<br /><br />

            Feels different.<br />
            Feels right.<br />
            Feels whole.
